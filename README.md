#PRONTO – Final Project


This repository contains the work carried out as part of the PRONTO project (IMT Atlantique, 2025).
The objective was to design and implement methods for robotic interaction through language grounding and object-centric motion generation.

The project was divided into two main subgroups:
	1.	Language Grounding – linking natural language commands with robot perception and actions.
	2.	Object-Centric Motion Generation – generating and controlling robot movements based on object detection and manipulation tasks.
